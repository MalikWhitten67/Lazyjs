# Lazy.js


what is the purpose of  Lazy.js?

 Lazy.js aimes to make js easy for not only new people but also intermediate users to

Its as simple as this - 
```js

// adds two numbers together
var number = Add(1, 20)
var divide = Add(2, 10)
trace(number + divide)
```
```
Output: 33! - its that easy
```


Why use func? -  the reason is bc u need to keep code clean and concise especially when theirs tons of it, theirs not a requirement just its recommended!

```js
func(
 
 trace("Hello world"),
 // always add , between new lines of lazyjs otherwise it will not return the code!

)

```

What does trace do?
Trace is like console.log() except its simpler for lazy people
