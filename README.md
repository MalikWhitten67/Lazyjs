# Lazy.js


what is the purpose of  Lazy.js?

 Lazy.js aimes to make js easy for not only new people but also intermediate users to

Its as simple as this - 
```js

// adds two numbers together
func(
var addition  = Add(10, 10)
trace(addition)

)

```
```
Output: 20! - its that easy
```


Why use func? -  the reason is bc u need to keep code clean and concise especially when theirs tons of it, theirs not a requirement just its recommended!

```js
func(
 
 trace("Hello world"),
 
  

)

```

What does trace do?
Trace is like console.log() except its simpler for lazy people

##Comments


```js

func(
'this is a single line comment',

"this is a single line comment aswell",

`  

 this is a multiline comment
,
`

com(
`

this here is a simple comment organizer def recommended!

`


),


)



```

example code
```js
func(
    // Declarations help organize your code so that it isnt messy!
    main(
        // log to console
        trace('hello world'),

        // log integers you can use this to return a string to integer
        trace(Integer("test", 300),


        ),
        // get the element with the id = to set parameter
        trace(getid("p")),
        // wait a few seconds then trace add 1 + 10 + string 200
        wait(() => { trace(Add(1, 10) + String('200')) }, 300),

    ),

    // use elements constructor to further keep code clean

    elements(
        // create an element
        MakeElement("body", "span",),
        // set innerhtml
        SetHtml(/* this is an id*/'body', '<div><p>hello world</p></div>'),
        // query an element useful for alot of logical code
        trace(query("p")),



        // styling - this is where u can put element styles!


        setBackColor("body", "blue"),

        setColor("blue", "body"),

    ),
      
      
 )


```
